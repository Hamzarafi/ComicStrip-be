> This project is a Node.js and Express-based backend service for managing XKCD comic data. It fetches comic details from the XKCD API, handles view counts, and serves the data to the frontend.

**Features:**
- Fetch comic details from the XKCD API.
- Track and store the number of times each comic is viewed.
- Serve comic data to the frontend with view count.
- API to fetch the latest comic, navigate by comic number, or get a random comic.
- Error handling for API requests and database operations.

**Technologies Used:**
- Node.js
- Express
- SQLite for persistent storage
- Axios for API requests
- Deployed with CI/CD pipelines
